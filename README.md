# Why make this plugin?

Siyuan Notes supports setting icons at the bottom of the title image, which is very beautiful, but the default randomization is to randomly select from all icons, and it is not easy to randomly select the icon you like. In many cases, you have to click the "Random" button many times to randomly select the icon you like. If you use notes frequently, this process will be very painful, so I developed this plugin to set the range of random icons according to personal preferences. For example, I usually choose the "Food and Drinks" group.

# Function introduction

The siyuan-icon-tools plugin is used to manage icons in the title bar. Currently supported functions are as follows:
- Support icon group selection, multiple selections, default selection.
- Support mouse "right-click" on the icon to randomly fill the icon.
- Modify the number of icon documents and outline linkage.

The current grouping is the same as the official grouping of Siyuan:
- Expressions and characters
- Animals and nature
- Food and drink
- Activities
- Travel and places
- Objects
- Symbols
- Flags

# How to use

Select "Add icon", click on the blank space to cancel the Siyuan default icon selection pop-up window, move the mouse to the icon position and "right-click" once to randomly select an icon in the group. The following is a demonstration:
